# HTML & CSS Intro Blog By: Raphael Dozzi (July/Aug 2020)

## Introduction

This is the first assignment of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. For this assignment, we were asked to make a blog with cards and a blog post. Using Flex and Grid features, I created a picture gallery blog with pictures from three different countries, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Croatia.

## Contents
The blog contains and index (index.html) file for the starting page followed by individual, though similar, pages for Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Croatia.

Included CSS files are index_style and blog_style for both the index and blog pages and a header, footer, and button style for individual components.

## Cloning

Feel free to clone and contribute if you would like. This is an introductory project and i'm pretty "green" regarding front-end development. I am open to comments and suggestions for improvment.
